# Spica

## About

Spica is a prototype game engine developed from scratch in C++ as part of [UPC's Master's degree in advanced programming for AAA video games](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/201200/master-advanced-programming-aaa-video-games/).

Being a prototype, the engine has limited functionality (described in the [Functionality](#Functionality) section); mainly, it allows the user to load an inspect an `.fbx` model. That said, a lot of care has been placed in making the engine well organized and extensible in the hopes it can serve as a base for the engine that will be developed throughout the Master's degree.

After finishing my Informatics Engineering degree, specializing in Software Engineering, I enrolled on the [master](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/201200/master-advanced-programming-aaa-video-games/) in the hopes of being able to joint the video game industry and help creating some of the worderful experiences games can bring.
